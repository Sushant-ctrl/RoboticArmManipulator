# ROBOTIC ARMS

The robotic arm has a variety of applications from heavy industrial applications, like welding to painting and drilling to doing tasks requiring high precision like doing surgeries. They are used in various environments from handling food packages to handling radioactive substances.

This repository is a step to understanding the basics of Robotic arms and working with the modern hardware and software implementations that involve robotic arms.

To start with I have followed the course [Introduction to Robotic arms, by Oussama Khatib]().

The following will be implemented

- [x] Forward Kinematics
- [ ] Dynamic Equations
- [ ] Inverse Kinematics
- [ ] Manipulator Equations
- [ ] Implementation of Optimal Controls
- [ ] Implementation of RL algorithms
